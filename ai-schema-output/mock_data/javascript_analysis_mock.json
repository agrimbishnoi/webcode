    "Overall Assessment: High likelihood of AI generation based on multiple factors.",
    "[COMMENTS]: Excessive explanatory comments (15 comments for 52 lines), typical AI verbosity pattern.",
    "[FORMATTING]: Perfect 2-space indentation consistency and proper semicolon usage throughout.",
    "[NAMING]: Overly descriptive variable names like 'userInputValidationResult' and 'processedDataArray'.",
    "[COMPLEXITY]: Use of modern ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring) in simple context suggests AI generation.",
    "[CONSTRUCTS]: Found 2 very short functions potentially used only once, suggesting excessive abstraction.",
    "[STRUCTURE]: Code defines structures (functions/classes) but lacks clear top-level execution or exports, potentially resembling an AI-generated example snippet.",
