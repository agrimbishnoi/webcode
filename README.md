# Syntax Sentry

**AI-Powered Code Analysis and Activity Tracking Platform**

Syntax Sentry is an advanced Chrome extension and web platform designed to detect and analyze potential cheating behaviors in coding assessments, particularly on platforms like LeetCode. By tracking user activity, code modifications, and behavioral patterns, it ensures fair competition and maintains academic integrity.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Activity Monitoring**: Tracks user interactions including keystrokes, copy/paste events, tab switches, and code submissions
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Advanced machine learning models detect suspicious patterns and AI-generated code
- **Behavioral Pattern Detection**: Analyzes typing patterns, timing intervals, and user behavior to identify potential cheating
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Currently optimized for LeetCode with extensible architecture for other coding platforms

### Dashboard Features
- **Activity Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of all user activities with filtering and search capabilities
- **Grouped View**: Organize activities by username and problem for better analysis
- **Real-time Updates**: Live monitoring of user activities and AI analysis results
- **Suspicion Scoring**: AI-generated suspicion scores with detailed breakdowns
- **Room Management**: Create and manage activity monitoring rooms for group assessments

### AI Analysis Capabilities
- **Copy/Paste Detection**: Identifies rapid copy-paste behaviors and analyzes copied content
- **Keystroke Analysis**: Detects unnatural typing patterns and timing anomalies
- **Tab Activity Monitoring**: Tracks focus changes and time spent away from coding environment
- **Code Generation Detection**: Identifies AI-generated code with confidence percentages
- **Behavioral Scoring**: Comprehensive scoring system based on multiple suspicious factors

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Custom components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for state management
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth user interactions
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode with system preference detection

### Backend (Next.js API Routes)

- **Database Integration**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Real-time Processing**: Asynchronous AI analysis triggering
- **CORS Support**: Cross-origin resource sharing for Chrome extension integration

### AI Analysis Engine (Python)

- **Copy Analysis** (`copymain.py`): Detects and analyzes copy operations
- **Paste Analysis** (`paste.py`): Evaluates pasted content for suspicious patterns
- **Tab Analysis** (`tab.py`): Monitors tab switching and focus behavior

### Database Schema
- **Activities Collection**: Stores user interaction events with detailed metadata
- **AI Responses Collection**: Stores AI analysis results and suspicion scores
- **Rooms Collection**: Manages group monitoring sessions

## üì¶ Installation

   cd extension-web
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   FASTAPI_URL=your_fastapi_endpoint_url
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   - Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster
   - Create collections: `activities`, `airesponses`, `rooms`
   - Update connection string in environment variables

5. **Run the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üîß Configuration

### AI Analysis Thresholds
The system uses configurable thresholds for detecting suspicious behavior:

```python
# Key Analysis Thresholds
FAST_TYPING_THRESHOLD_MS = 50
LONG_GAP_THRESHOLD_MS = 15000
RAPID_PASTE_CTRL_V_THRESHOLD_MS = 300

# Copy Analysis Weights
WEIGHTS = {
    'length_very_short': 0,
    'length_medium': 5,
    'length_long': 15,
    'length_very_long': 25,
    'code_keywords': 20,
    'code_structure': 15,
    'specific_solution_keywords': 35
}
```

### Event Types
The system tracks various event types:
- `key_press`: Individual keystroke events
- `copy`: Content copy operations
- `paste`: Content paste operations
- `submission`: Code submission events
- `window_blurred`/`window_focused`: Window focus changes
- `tab_activated`/`tab_deactivated`: Tab switching events

## üìä API Endpoints

### Activity Management
- `POST /api/activity` - Log new user activity
- `GET /api/activity` - Retrieve activities with pagination and filtering

### AI Analysis
- `POST /api/airesponse` - Trigger AI analysis for specific activity
- `POST /api/airesponse/check` - Check AI analysis status for multiple activities

### User Management
